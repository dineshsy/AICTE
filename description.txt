About this App : PREVAIL

 This is an App to serve the people in need during the current crisis(COVID-19).It is a Community consisting of a group of people 
who are in need of something and a group of people who are willing to volunteer (We call them 'Guardians') to help those who are in need.
We would like to call ourselves "The Bridge" which stands steady in order to connect these two groups of people forming an open community.
And we also stand as a Bridge between connecting people with Experts both from the Medical field and Helpline Centers that are 
running 24/7 across the state to provide guidance to the people. We have a System which continuously updates the current Statistics of India, 
By the Total Number of Cases, Deaths, Recovered and Active Cases at the Current time. And a Statewise Bar chart is Provided in the App, Which
gives information about the top 5 states that are affected by the virus.

 The Main connect of the App is about community building, We have added Google Login Feature in order to keep track of the number of
people using the app, and also to get the details of the user easily without needing to query him with a number of Questions. It is widely used for Medical, Food and Shelter or any other needs can be typed in the Description Below. Once the Help is Requested, all the 
Volunteers who are connected through the app will receive a mail stating the needs of the person and his current location. Thus volunteers can
can help those people either by calling them by the Mobile number and Contacting them through their address. The Other part of the Community is 
registering as a volunteer, Thanks to the Google Signin, this process has been made so simple by just giving a single tap on Join now button, 
you will receive an automatic mail for the confirmation. And you are officially added as part of the community, any request from a person in need 
will be sent as mail to you and you get to be the Guardian of their Life !
